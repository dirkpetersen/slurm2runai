# Install and Configure CLI

This section explains the procedure for installing and configuring the researcher Command Line Interface.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

This section refers to CLI v2 only. CLI v1 is supported for clusters below 2.18 only.
{% endhint %}

## Prerequisites

* Only clusters that are version 2.18 or above are supported.
* For Alpine Linux OS, make sure you have bash and curl installed.

## Installing the CLI

1. Click the **Help (?)** icon in the top right corner
2. Select **Researcher Command Line Interface**
3. Select the **cluster** you want the CLI to communicate with
4. Select your computer’s **operating system**
5. Copy the installer command and run it in the terminal or download the binary file for **Windows** OS
6. Follow the installation process instructions
7. Click `Enter` to use the default values (recommended)

### Testing the Installation

To verify the CLI client was installed properly

1. Open the terminal
2. Run the command `runai version`

## Configuring the CLI

Follow the steps below to configure the CLI.

### Setting the Control Plane URL <a href="#setting-the-control-plane-url" id="setting-the-control-plane-url"></a>

The following step is required for Windows users only. Linux and Mac clients are configured via the installation script automatically

Run the command `runai config set --cp-url <CONTROL_PLANE_URL>`. This will also create the `config.json` file in the default path.

### Authenticating the CLI

After installation, sign in to the NVIDIA Run:ai platform to authenticate the CLI.

1. Open the terminal on your local machine
2. Run `runai login`
3. Enter your username and password in the NVIDIA Run:ai platform's sign-in page
4. Return to the terminal window to use the CLI

### Setting a Default Cluster

If only one cluster is connected to the account, it is set as the default cluster when you first sign-in. If there are multiple clusters, you must follow the steps below to set your preferred cluster for workload submission:

1. Open the terminal on your local machine
2. Run `runai cluster` and select the desired cluster from the interactive menu.

Alternatively:

1. Open the terminal on your local machine.
2. Run `runai cluster list` to find the desired cluster name.
3. Run the following command `runai cluster set <CLUSTER_NAME>`.

### Setting a Default Project

Set a default working project, to easily submit workloads without mentioning the project name in every command.

1. Open the terminal on your local machine.
2. Run `runai project` and select the desired cluster from the interactive menu.

Alternatively:

1. Open the terminal on your local machine.
2. Run `runai cluster list` to find the desired project name.
3. Run the following command `runai project set <PROJECT_NAME>`
4. If successful, the following message is returned `project <PROJECT_NAME> configured successfully.`

### Validating the Configuration <a href="#validating-the-configuration" id="validating-the-configuration"></a>

To view the current configuration run `runai config generate --json`
