# Logs Collection

This guide provides instructions for IT administrators on collecting NVIDIA Run:ai logs for support, including prerequisites, CLI commands, and log file retrieval. It also covers enabling verbose logging for Prometheus and the NVIDIA Run:ai Scheduler.

## Collect Logs to Send to Support

To collect NVIDIA Run:ai logs, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have administrator-level access to the Kubernetes cluster where NVIDIA Run:ai is installed.
* The NVIDIA Run:ai [CLI](/self-hosted/reference/cli/install-cli.md) must be installed.

### Step-by-step Instructions

1. Open a terminal on any machine where the NVIDIA Run:ai CLI is installed and configured with access to the Kubernetes cluster. The user running this command typically requires system administrator [permissions](/self-hosted/infrastructure-setup/authentication/roles.md), including access to pods and namespaces.
2. Collect the Logs. Execute the following command to collect the logs. See the [CLI commands reference](/self-hosted/reference/cli/runai/runai-diagnostics.md) for more details:

   ```bash
   runai diagnostics collect-logs
   ```

This command gathers diagnostic logs from your Kubernetes cluster to facilitate troubleshooting or support requests with NVIDIA Run:ai Support. The following optional flags are available:

| Flag                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--output-dir <path>` | Directory where the log archive is saved. Defaults to the directory from which the command is run.                                                                                  |
| `--namespaces <list>` | Comma-separated list of namespaces to collect logs from. Defaults to `runai`, `runai-reservation`, `runai-backend`, `training-operator`, `knative`, `gpu-operator`, `nim-operator`. |
| `--no-previous`       | Excludes previous pod logs from the collection.                                                                                                                                     |

3. After the command completes, the CLI displays the path of the generated compressed log file. Send this file to NVIDIA Run:ai Support for troubleshooting.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

The command collects diagnostic logs from Kubernetes namespaces in a NVIDIA Run:ai installation. By default, logs are collected from the following namespaces: `runai`, `runai-reservation`, `runai-backend`, `training-operator`, `knative`, `gpu-operator`, and `nim-operator`. Use the `--namespaces` flag to target specific namespaces.
{% endhint %}

## Logs Verbosity

Increase log verbosity to capture more detailed information, providing deeper insights into system behavior and make it easier to identify and resolve issues.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* Access to the Kubernetes cluster where NVIDIA Run:ai is installed
  * Including [necessary permissions](/self-hosted/infrastructure-setup/authentication/roles.md) to view and modify configurations.
* kubectl installed and configured:
  * The Kubernetes command-line tool, `kubectl`, must be installed and configured to interact with the cluster.
  * Sufficient privileges to edit configurations and view logs.
* Monitoring Disk Space
  * When enabling verbose logging, ensure adequate disk space to handle the increased log output, especially when enabling debug or high verbosity levels.

### Adding Verbosity

<details>

<summary>Adding verbosity to Prometheus</summary>

To increase the logging verbosity for Prometheus, follow these steps:

1. Edit the `RunaiConfig` to adjust Prometheus log levels. Copy the following command to your terminal:

   ```bash
   kubectl edit runaiconfig runai -n runai
   ```
2. In the configuration file that opens, add or modify the following section to set the log level to `debug`:

   ```bash
   spec:
     prometheus:
       spec:
         logLevel: debug
   ```
3. Save the changes. To view the Prometheus logs with the new verbosity level, run:

   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n runai prometheus-runai-0 
   ```

   This command streams the last 100 lines of logs from Prometheus, providing detailed information useful for debu

<summary>Adding verbosity to the Scheduler</summary>

To enable extended logging for the NVIDIA Run:ai scheduler:

1. Edit the `RunaiConfig` to adjust scheduler verbosity:

   ```bash
   kubectl edit runaiconfig runai -n runai
   ```
2. Add or modify the following section under the scheduler settings:

   ```bash
   runai-scheduler:
     args:
       verbosity: 6
   ```

   This increases the verbosity level of the scheduler logs to provide more detailed output.

**Warning:** Enabling verbose logging can significantly increase disk space usage. Monitor your storage capacity and adjust the verbosity level as necessary.
