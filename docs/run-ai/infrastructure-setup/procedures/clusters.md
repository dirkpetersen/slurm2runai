## Adding a New Cluster

Follow the setup and installation instructions below to get the installation instructions to install the NVIDIA Run:ai cluster.

### Setup

1. In the NVIDIA Run:ai UI, go to Resources -> Clusters
2. Enter a unique **name** for your cluster
3. Optional: Choose the NVIDIA Run:ai cluster version (latest, by default)
4. Enter the Cluster URL. For more information, see [Fully Qualified Domain Name](/self-hosted/getting-started/installation/install-using-helm/system-requirements.md#fully-qualified-domain-name-fqdn) requirement.
5. Click **CONTINUE**

### Installation Instructions

1. Follow the installation instructions and run the commands provided on your Kubernetes cluster. To add a new cluster, see the [installation guide](/self-hosted/getting-started/installation/install-using-helm/helm-install.md).
2. Click **DONE**

The cluster is displayed in the table with the status **Waiting to connect**. Once installation is complete, the cluster status changes to **Connected**.

## Managing Network Topologies

Network topologies optimize placement and accelerate distributed workloads by keeping pods on nodes that are as close to each other as possible in the network. For more details, see [Accelerating workloads with network topology-aware scheduling](/self-hosted/platform-management/aiinitiatives/resources/topology-aware-scheduling.md).

To add topologies that represent the cluster's network:

1. Select the cluster you want to add a network topology for
2. In the top action bar, click **NETWORK TOPOLOGIES**
3. In the **Network Topologies Associated with \<Cluster Name>** modal, click **+ NETWORK TOPOLOGY**
4. Enter a unique **name** for the topology. If the name already exists, you will be requested to enter a different name.
5. Click **+ LABEL** to add the node label keys that represent the network hierarchy
   * Order labels from farthest (first) to closest (last)
   * Ensure the labels match the corresponding keys on the nodes. For example: `cloud.provider.com/topology-block`, `cloud.provider.com/topology-rack`, `kubernetes.io/hostname`
   * Drag labels to adjust their order if needed
6. Click **SAVE NETWORK TOPOLOGY**

After creating the network topology, the administrator must associate it with the relevant node pool(s). See [Node pools](/self-hosted/platform-management/aiinitiatives/resources/node-pools.md) for more details:

* If you are using the default node pool (that is, no additional node pools are defined), attach the topology to the default node pool.
* If different node pools have different topologies, each node pool must be linked to its corresponding topology.
* If the entire cluster shares the same topology, link the same topology to all node pools.

## Removing a Cluster

1. Select the cluster you want to remove
2. Click **REMOVE**
3. A dialog appears: Make sure to carefully read the message before removing
4. Click **REMOVE** to confirm the removal.

## Using the API

Go to the [Clusters](https://run-ai-docs.nvidia.com/api/2.25/organizations/clusters) API reference to view the available actions

## Troubleshooting

Before starting, make sure you have access to the Kubernetes cluster where NVIDIA Run:ai is deployed with the necessary permissions

### Troubleshooting Scenarios

<details>

<summary>Cluster disconnected</summary>

**Description:** When the cluster's status is ‘disconnected’, there is no communication from the cluster services reaching the NVIDIA Run:ai Platform. This may be due to networking issues or issues with NVIDIA Run:ai services.

**Mitigation:**

1. Check NVIDIA Run:ai’s services status:
   1. Open your terminal
   2. Make sure you have access to the Kubernetes cluster with permissions to view pods
   3. Copy and paste the following command to verify that NVIDIA Run:ai’s services are running:

      ```bash
      kubectl get pods -n runai | grep -E 'runai-agent|cluster-sync|assets-sync'
      ```
   4. If any of the services are not running, see the ‘cluster has service issues’ scenario.
2. **Check the network connection**
   1. Open your terminal
   2. Make sure you have access to the Kubernetes cluster with permissions to create pods
   3. Copy and paste the following command to create a connectivity check pod:

      ```bash
      kubectl run control-plane-connectivity-check -n runai --image=wbitt/network-multitool --command -- /bin/sh -c 'curl -sSf <control-plane-endpoint> > /dev/null && echo "Connection Successful" || echo "Failed connecting to the Control Plane"'
      ```
   4. Replace `<control-plane-endpoint>` with the URL of the Control Plane in your environment. If the pod fails to connect to the Control Plane, check for potential network policies
3. **Check and modify the network policies**
   1. Open your terminal
   2. Copy and paste the following command to check the existence of network policies:

      ```bash
      kubectl get networkpolicies -n runai
      ```
   3. Review the policies to ensure that they allow traffic from the NVIDIA Run:ai namespace to the Control Plane. If necessary, update the policies to allow the required traffic

      Example of allowing traffic:

      ```yaml
      apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
      kind: NetworkPolicy
      metadata:
        name: allow-control-plane-traffic
        namespace: runai
      spec:
        podSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: runai
        policyTypes:
          - Ingress
          - Egress
        egress:
          - to:
              - ipBlock:
                  cidr: <control-plane-ip-range>
            ports:
              - protocol: TCP
                port: <control-plane-port>
        ingress:
          - from:
              - ipBlock:
                  cidr: <control-plane-ip-range>
            ports:
              - protocol: TCP
                port: <control-plane-port>
      ```
   4. Check infrastructure-level configurations:
      * Ensure that firewall rules and security groups allow traffic between your Kubernetes cluster and the Control Plane
      * Verify required ports and protocols:
        * Ensure that the necessary ports and protocols for NVIDIA Run:ai’s services are not blocked by any firewalls or security groups
4. **Check NVIDIA Run:ai services logs**
   1. Open your terminal
   2. Make sure you have access to the Kubernetes cluster with permissions to view logs
   3. Copy and paste the following commands to view the logs of the NVIDIA Run:ai services:

      ```bash
      kubectl logs deployment/runai-agent -n runai
      kubectl logs deployment/cluster-sync -n runai
      kubectl logs deployment/assets-sync -n runai
      ```
   4. Try to identify the problem from the logs. If you cannot resolve the issue, continue to the next step.
5. **Diagnosing internal network issues:**\
   NVIDIA Run:ai operates on Kubernetes, which uses its internal subnet and DNS services for communication between pods and services. If you find connectivity issues in the logs, the problem might be related to Kubernetes' internal networking.

   To diagnose DNS or connectivity issues, you can start a debugging {{glossary.Pod}} with networking utilities:

   1. Copy the following command to your terminal, to start a pod with networking tools:

      ```bash
      kubectl run -i --tty netutils --image=dersimn/netutils -- bash
      ```

      This command creates an interactive pod (`netutils`) where you can use networking commands like `ping`, `curl`, `nslookup`, etc., to troubleshoot network issues.
   2. Use this pod to perform network resolution tests and other diagnostics to identify any DNS or connectivity problems within your Kubernetes {{glossary.Cluster}}.
6. **Contact NVIDIA Run:ai’s support**
   * If the issue persists, [contact NVIDIA Run:ai’s support](https://www.nvidia.com/en-eu/support/enterprise/#contact-us) for assistance.

<summary>Cluster is missing prerequisites</summary>

**Description:** When a cluster's status displays Missing prerequisites, it indicates that at least one of the Mandatory Prerequisites has not been fulfilled. In such cases, NVIDIA Run:ai services may not function properly.

**Mitigation:**

If you have ensured that all prerequisites are installed and the status still shows *missing prerequisites*, follow these steps:

1. Check the message in the NVIDIA Run:ai platform for further details regarding the missing prerequisites.
2. **Inspect the** `runai-public` ConfigMap:
   1. Open your terminal. In the terminal, type the following command to list all ConfigMaps in the `runai` namespace:

      ```bash
      kubectl get configmap runai-public -n runai
      ```
3. **Describe the ConfigMap**
   1. Locate the ConfigMap named `runai-public` from the list
   2. To view the detailed contents of this ConfigMap, type the following command:

      ```bash
      kubectl describe configmap runai-public -n runai
      ```
4. **Find Missing Prerequisites**
   1. In the output displayed, look for a section labeled `dependencies.required`
   2. This section provides detailed information about any missing resources or prerequisites. Review this information to identify what is needed
5. **Contact NVIDIA Run:ai’s support**
