# Workloads

This guide describes how to view, monitor, and manage workloads running on the NVIDIA Run:ai platform.

## Workloads Table

The Workloads table can be found under **Workload manager** in the NVIDIA Run:ai platform.

The workloads table provides a list of all the workloads scheduled on the NVIDIA Run:ai [Scheduler](/self-hosted/platform-management/runai-scheduler/scheduling/concepts-and-principles.md), and allows you to manage them.

  Per GPU graph and an average of all GPUs graph, all on the same chart, along an adjustable period allows you to see the trends of all GPUs compute utilization (percentage of GPU compute) in this node.
* **GPU memory utilization**\
  Per GPU graph and an average of all GPUs graph, all on the same chart, along an adjustable period allows you to see the trends of all GPUs memory usage (percentage of the GPU memory) in this node.
* **CPU compute utilization**\
  The average of all CPUs’ cores compute utilization graph, along an adjustable period allows you to see the trends of CPU compute utilization (percentage of CPU compute) in this node.
* **CPU memory utilization**\
  The utilization of all CPUs memory in a single graph, along an adjustable period allows you to see the trends of CPU memory utilization (percentage of CPU memory) in this node.
* **CPU memory usage**\
  The usage of all CPUs memory in a single graph, along an adjustable period allows you to see the trends of CPU memory usage (in GB or MB of CPU memory) in this node.
* **NVLink bandwidth total**\
  The rate of data transmitted / received over NVLink, not including protocol headers, in bytes per second. The value represents an average over a time interval and is not an instantaneous value. The rate is averaged over the time interval. For example, if 1 GB of data is transferred over 1 second, the rate is 1 GB/s regardless of the data transferred at a constant rate or in bursts. The theoretical maximum NVLink Gen2 bandwidth is 25 GB/s per link per direction.

#### GPU Profiling

Select **GPU profiling** from the dropdown to view extended GPU device-level metrics such as memory bandwidth, SM occupancy, and other data.

* For the full list of supported metrics, see [Metrics and telemetry](/self-hosted/platform-management/monitor-performance/metrics.md#gpu-profiling).
* For definitions and technical descriptions, refer to the [NVIDIA documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/dcgm/latest/user-guide/feature-overview.html#profiling-metrics).

#### Inference

For inference workloads, select **Inference** from the dropdown to view dedicated inference metrics:

* **Throughput**\
  Displays the total number of inference requests per second (RPS). The chart shows request throughput over time, helping you analyze traffic patterns and scaling needs.
* **Latency**\
  Shows the average response time for inference requests in milliseconds. Use this chart to track performance, identify bottlenecks, and optimize model serving.
* **Replicas**\
  Displays the desired vs. actual number of replicas for inference workloads. This helps you understand autoscaling behavior and whether workloads are scaling as expected.

#### NVIDIA NIM

For NVIDIA NIM workloads, select **NVIDIA NIM** from the dropdown to view dedicated NIM-specific metrics:

* **Request concurrency by status**\
  Shows the number of inference requests that are currently running or waiting, along with the model’s maximum allowed concurrency.
* **Request count by status**\
  Displays the total number of inference requests completed over time, categorized as succeeded or failed.
* **Time to first token (TTFT)**\
  Shows a histogram of the time (in seconds) it takes for the model to generate the first token.
* **Time to first token (TTFT) by percentiles**\
  Tracks how long it takes for the model to generate the first token of a response, with percentile breakdowns (p50, p90, p99) for performance analysis.
* **End to end request latency**\
  Shows a histogram of the total request latency (in seconds), measured from request submission to completion.
* **End to end request latency by percentiles**\
  Measures the total response time from request submission to completion, with percentile values (p50, p90, p99) to help identify latency patterns.
* **GPU KV cache utilization**\
  Reports the percentage of GPU key-value cache currently in use over time.

#### Navigating the Graphs

* For GPUs charts - Click the GPU legend on the right-hand side of the chart, to activate or deactivate any of the GPU lines.
* You can click the date picker to change the presented period
* You can use your mouse to mark a sub-period in the graph for zooming in, and use **Reset zoom** to go back to the preset period
* Changes in the period affect all graphs on this screen.

#### Logs

Workload events are ordered in chronological order. The logs contain events from the workload’s lifecycle to help monitor and debug issues.

You can view logs per pod and per container. Use the dropdown menus to select the specific pod and the container within the pod you want to inspect. Use the **Container's logs from** dropdown to switch between the current and previous container instance logs.

Logs can also be downloaded for offline review. Each downloaded log file includes a unique name in the format:

```bash
<workload_name>_<pod_name>_<container_name>_<timestamp>.log
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

Logs are available only while the workload is in a non-terminal state. Once the workload completes or fails, logs are no longer accessible.
{% endhint %}

#### Terminal

Workload terminal provides interactive shell access to running containers and are ordered by creation time. The terminal reflects the live state of the container and is intended for real-time inspection, debugging, and manual intervention during execution.

You can open a terminal per pod and per container. Use the dropdown menus to select the specific pod and the container within the pod you want to connect to.

Each terminal session is ephemeral and exists only for the duration of the connection. Closing the terminal ends the session, and no session history is preserved.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

Terminal access is available only while the workload is in a running state. Once the workload completes, fails, or is suspended, terminal access is no longer available.
{% endhint %}

#### Structure

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

The Structure tab is available for [supported workload types](/self-hosted/workloads-in-nvidia-run-ai/submit-via-yaml.md) submitted via YAML only.
{% endhint %}

Displays a visual diagram of the workload's component hierarchy. The diagram shows a root workload node at the top, with child components (such as services, deployments, and microservices) arranged beneath it according to their parent-child relationships. Components that have additional details can be expanded to view their resource allocations and pod status.

## Built-in Workload Environment Variables

### Platform-Defined Variables

When a workload runs on the NVIDIA Run:ai platform, a number of environment variables are automatically injected into every container. These variables provide metadata about the workload’s context, such as the project it belongs to, the workload name, and a unique run identifier.

<table><thead><tr><th width="263.6015625">Variable</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>RUNAI_PROJECT</code></td><td>The NVIDIA Run:ai project (namespace) in which the workload runs</td></tr><tr><td><code>RUNAI_JOB_NAME</code></td><td>The logical name of the workload as submitted</td></tr><tr><td><code>RUNAI_JOB_UUID</code></td><td>A unique identifier for the workload. If a workload is deleted and recreated with the same name, the UUID will be different.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RUNAI_NUM_OF_GPUS</code></td><td>Number of GPUs allocated to the current container</td></tr><tr><td><code>NODE_NAME</code></td><td>The node where the container is currently running</td></tr><tr><td><code>RUNAI_MPI_NUM_WORKERS</code></td><td>The number of worker pods participating in the MPI distributed workload</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Usage Example in Python

```python
import os

jobName = os.environ['JOB_NAME']
jobUUID = os.environ['JOB_UUID']
```

### Framework-Defined Environment Variables

In addition to NVIDIA Run:ai’s built-in environment variables, distributed training frameworks inject their own variables to coordinate communication, rank assignment, and cluster topology. These variables differ by framework and are automatically managed by the training operator (for example, Kubeflow’s Training Operator or MPI Operator). The following table lists some of the most common framework-defined variables supported for distributed training. For a complete list of environment variables, refer to the official documentation for each framework.

<table><thead><tr><th width="174.04296875">Framework</th><th width="261.26171875">Common Environment Variables</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide">TensorFlow</a></td><td><code>TF_CONFIG</code></td><td>Defines the cluster topology and the role (chief, worker, ps) of each process</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html">PyTorch</a></td><td><code>RANK</code>, <code>WORLD_SIZE</code>, <code>MASTER_ADDR</code>, <code>MASTER_PORT</code></td><td>Used for initializing distributed process groups and inter-worker communication</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">XGBoost</a></td><td><code>DMLC_TRACKER_URI</code>, <code>DMLC_ROLE</code>, <code>DMLC_NUM_WORKER</code></td><td>Used by the XGBoost distributed training tracker for coordination between nodes</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://github.com/kubeflow/mpi-operator">MPI Operator</a></td><td><code>OMPI_COMM_WORLD_RANK</code>, <code>OMPI_COMM_WORLD_SIZE</code>, <code>OMPI_MCA_*</code></td><td>Standard OpenMPI variables for multi-process coordination</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/">JAX</a></td><td><code>XLA_FLAGS</code>, <code>TPU_VISIBLE_DEVICES</code>, <code>CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES</code></td><td>Control device visibility and XLA backend behavior</td></tr></tbody></table>

# Agent Instructions: Querying This Documentation

If you need additional information that is not directly available in this page, you can query the documentation dynamically by asking a question.

Perform an HTTP GET request on the current page URL with the `ask` query parameter:

```
GET https://run-ai-docs.nvidia.com/self-hosted/workloads-in-nvidia-run-ai/workloads.md?ask=<question>
```

The question should be specific, self-contained, and written in natural language.
The response will contain a direct answer to the question and relevant excerpts and sources from the documentation.

Use this mechanism when the answer is not explicitly present in the current page, you need clarification or additional context, or you want to retrieve related documentation sections.
