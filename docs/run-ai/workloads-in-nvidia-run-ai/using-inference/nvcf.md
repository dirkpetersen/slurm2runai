# Deploy NVIDIA Cloud Functions (NVCF) in NVIDIA Run:ai

NVIDIA Cloud Functions (NVCF) is a serverless API platform designed to deploy and manage AI workloads on GPUs. Through its integration with NVIDIA Run:ai, NVCF can be deployed directly onto NVIDIA Run:ai-managed GPU clusters. This allows users to take advantage of NVIDIA Run:ai's scheduling, quota management, and monitoring features. See [Supported features](#supported-features) for more details.

This guide provides the required steps for integrating NVIDIA Cloud Functions with the NVIDIA Run:ai platform.

## Workload Priority

By default, inference workloads in NVIDIA Run:ai are assigned a priority of `very-high`, which is non-preemptible. This behavior ensures that inference workloads, which often serve real-time or latency-sensitive traffic, are guaranteed the resources they need and will not be disrupted by other workloads. For more details, see [Workload priority control](/self-hosted/platform-management/runai-scheduler/scheduling/workload-priority-control.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

Changing the priority is not supported for NVCF workloads.
{% endhint %}

## Setup

Follow the official instructions provided in the [NVIDIA Cloud Functions](https://docs.nvidia.com/cloud-functions/user-guide/latest/cloud-function/overview.html) documentation.

### Setting up a Cluster in NVCF

Cloud Functions administrators can install the NVIDIA Cluster Agent to enable existing GPU clusters as deployment targets for NVCF functions. Once installed, the cluster appears as a deployment option in the API and Cloud Functions menu, allowing authorized functions to deploy on it. See [Cluster Setup & Management](https://docs.nvidia.com/cloud-functions/user-guide/latest/cloud-function/cluster-management.html) to register, configure and verify the cluster.

### Setting up a Project in NVIDIA Run:ai

Once the cluster is registered to NVCF and appears as ready, create a project in the NVIDIA Run:ai UI with an **NVCF namespace**:

1. Follow the instructions detailed in [Projects](/self-hosted/platform-management/aiinitiatives/organization/projects.md) to create a new project.
2. When setting the **Namespace**, choose **"Enter existing namespace from the cluster"** and enter **`nvcf-backend`**.
3. Assign the necessary resource quotas to the project.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

* This is the designated NVIDIA Run:ai project for all NVCF functions; other projects will not be used.
* NVCF is assigned to a specific project and adheres to the project's resource quota. Ensure that your project has sufficient quota allocated to accommodate.
  {% endhint %}

## Deploying a Function

In NVCF, function creation defines the code and resources while deployment registers the function to a GPU cluster, making it available for execution:

1. Create the function as detailed in [Function Creation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cloud-functions/user-guide/latest/cloud-function/function-creation.html#function-creation).
2. Deploy the function as detailed in [Function Deployment](https://docs.nvidia.com/cloud-functions/user-guide/latest/cloud-function/function-deployment.html).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

Using a custom Helm chart when creating a [Cloud Function](https://docs.nvidia.com/cloud-functions/user-guide/latest/cloud-function/function-creation.html) is not supported.
{% endhint %}

## Managing and Monitoring

After the NVCF function is deployed, it is added to the [Workloads](/self-hosted/workloads-in-nvidia-run-ai/workloads.md) table, where it can be managed and monitored:

* Monitor resource usage, performance, and execution status.
* Manage workload lifecycle, including scaling, logging, and troubleshooting.
