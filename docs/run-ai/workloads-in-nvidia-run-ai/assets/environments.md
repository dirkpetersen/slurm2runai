# Environments

Environments are one type of [workload assets](/self-hosted/workloads-in-nvidia-run-ai/assets/overview.md). An environment consists of a configuration that simplifies how workloads are submitted and can be used by AI practitioners when they submit their workloads.

An environment asset is a preconfigured building block that encapsulates aspects for the workload such as:

* Container image and container configuration
* Tools and connections
* The type of workload it serves

## Environments Table

The Environments table can be found under **Workload manager** in the NVIDIA Run:ai platform.

The Environment table provides a list of all the environment defined in the platform and allows you to manage them.

## Environments Created by NVIDIA Run:ai

When installing NVIDIA Run:ai, you automatically get the environments created by NVIDIA Run:ai to ease up the onboarding process and support different use cases out of the box. These environments are created at the [scope](/self-hosted/workloads-in-nvidia-run-ai/assets/overview.md#asset-scope) of the account.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

The environments listed below are available based on your cluster settings. Some environments, such as vscode and rstudio, are only available in clusters with [host-based routing](/self-hosted/infrastructure-setup/advanced-setup/container-access/external-access-to-containers.md#host-based-routing).

## Adding a New Environment

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

* NGC catalog is disabled by default. If unavailable, your administrator must enable it under **General settings** → Workloads → NGC catalog.
* To select an image from the NGC private registr&#x79;**,** your administrator must configure it under **General settings** → Workloads → NGC private registry.
  {% endhint %}

Environment creation is limited to [specific roles](/self-hosted/workloads-in-nvidia-run-ai/assets/overview.md#who-can-create-an-asset)

To add a new environment:

1. Go to the Environments table
2. Click **+NEW ENVIRONMENT**
3. Select under which cluster to create the environment
4. Select a [scope](/self-hosted/workloads-in-nvidia-run-ai/assets/overview.md#asset-scope)
5. Enter a **name** for the environment. The name must be unique.
6. Optional: Provide a **description** of the essence of the environment
7. Set the **environment image**:
   * Select **Custom image** and enter the **Image URL**. If a token or secret is required to pull the image, it is possible to create it via [user credentials](/self-hosted/settings/user-settings/user-credentials.md) of type docker registry. These credentials are automatically used once the image is pulled (which happens when the workload is submitted)
   * **Select from the NGC catalog** and choose the **image name** and **tag** from the dropdown.
   * **Select from the NGC private registry** and then set how to access the registry:
     * Select a **registry** from the dropdown.
     * Under **Source**, select [**Shared secret**](/self-hosted/workloads-in-nvidia-run-ai/assets/credentials.md#ngc-api-key).
     * The **Type** field is fixed to **NGC API key**.
     * Under **Credential name**, select an existing credential from the dropdown.
8. Set the **image pull policy** - the condition for when to pull the image from the registry
9. Set the workload architecture:
   * **Standard**\
     Only standard workloads can use the environment. A standard workload consists of a single process.
   * **Distributed**\
     Only distributed workloads can use the environment. A distributed workload consists of multiple processes working together. These processes can run on different nodes.
     * Select a framework from the list.
10. Set the workload type:
    * **Workspace**
    * **Training**
    * **Inference**
      * When inference is selected, define the **endpoint** of the model by providing both the protocol and the container’s serving port
11. Optional: Set the connection for your **tool(s)**. The tools must be configured in the image. When submitting a workload using the environment, it is possible to connect to these tools
    * Select the tool from the list (the available tools varies from IDE, experiment tracking, and more, including a custom tool for your choice)
    * Select the connection type
      * **External URL**
        * **Auto generate**\
          A unique URL is automatically created for each workload using the environment
        * **Custom URL**\
          The URL is set manually
      * **Node port**
        * **Auto generate**\
          A unique port is automatically exposed for each workload using the environment
        * **Custom URL**\
          Set the port manually
      * Set the **container port**
12. Optional: Set a **command and arguments** for the container running the pod
    * When no command is added, the default command of the image is used (the image entrypoint)
    * The command can be modified while submitting a workload using the environment
    * The argument(s) can be modified while submitting a workload using the environment
13. Optional: **Set the environment variable(s)**
    * Click **+ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE**
    * Enter a **name**
    * Select the **source** for the environment variable
      * **Custom**
        * Enter a **value**
        * Leave **empty**
        * Add **instructions** for the expected value if any
      * **Credentials** - Select an existing credential as the environment variable
        * Select a **credential name**\
          To add new credentials to the credentials list, and for additional information, see [Credentials](/self-hosted/workloads-in-nvidia-run-ai/assets/credentials.md).
        * Select a **secret key**
      * **ConfigMap** - Select a predefined ConfigMap
        * Select a **ConfigMap name**\
          To create a ConfigMap in your cluster, see [Creating ConfigMaps in advance](/self-hosted/workloads-in-nvidia-run-ai/assets/datasources.md#creating-configmaps-in-advance).
        * Enter a **ConfigMap key**
    * The environment variables can be modified and new variables can be added while submitting a workload using the environment
14. Optional: Set the container’s **working directory** to define where the container’s process starts running. When left empty, the default directory is used.
15. Optional: Set where the UID, GID and supplementary groups are taken from, this can be:
    * **From the image**
    * **From the IdP token** (only available in an SSO installations)
    * **Custom** (manually set) - decide whether the submitter can modify these value upon submission.
      * Set the **User ID (UID)**, **Group ID (GID)** and the supplementary groups that can run commands in the container
        * Enter **UID**
        * Enter **GID**
        * Add **Supplementary groups** (multiple groups can be added, separated by commas)
        * Disable **Allow the values above to be modified within the workload** if you want the above values to be used as the default
16. Optional: Select **Linux capabilities** - Grant certain privileges to a container without granting all the privileges of the root user.
17. Click **CREATE ENVIRONMENT**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

It is also possible to add environments directly when creating a specific [workspace](/self-hosted/workloads-in-nvidia-run-ai/using-workspaces.md), [training](/self-hosted/workloads-in-nvidia-run-ai/using-training.md) or [inference](/self-hosted/workloads-in-nvidia-run-ai/using-inference.md) workload.
{% endhint %}

## Editing an Environment

To edit an existing environment:

1. Select the environment you want to edit
2. Click **Edit**
3. Update the environment and click **SAVE ENVIRONMENT**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

* The already bound workload that is using this asset will not be affected.
* llm-server and chatbot-ui environments cannot be edited.
  {% endhint %}

## Copying an Environment

To copy an existing environment:

1. Select the environment you want to copy
2. Click **MAKE A COPY**
