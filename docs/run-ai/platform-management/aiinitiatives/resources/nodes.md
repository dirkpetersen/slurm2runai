# Nodes

Nodes are Kubernetes elements automatically discovered by the NVIDIA Run:ai platform. Once a node is discovered by the NVIDIA Run:ai platform, an associated instance is created in the Nodes table, administrators can view the Node’s relevant information, and NVIDIA Run:ai scheduler can use the node for [Scheduling](/self-hosted/platform-management/runai-scheduler/scheduling/how-the-scheduler-works.md).

## Nodes Table

The Nodes table can be found under **Resources** in the NVIDIA Run:ai platform.

The Nodes table displays a list of predefined nodes available to users in the NVIDIA Run:ai platform.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

* It is not possible to create additional nodes, or edit, or delete existing nodes.
* Only users with relevant permissions can view the table.

The Nodes table consists of the following columns:

### Pods Associated with a Node

Click one of the values in the Pod(s) column, to view the list of pods and their parameters.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

This column is only viewable if your role in the NVIDIA Run:ai platform gives you read access to workloads, even if you are allowed to view workloads, you can only view the workloads within your allowed scope. This means, there might be more pods running on this node then appear in the list you are viewing.

### Customizing the Table View

* Filter - Click ADD FILTER, select the column to filter by, and enter the filter values
* Search - Click SEARCH and type the value to search by
* Sort - Click each column header to sort by
* Column selection - Click COLUMNS and select the columns to display in the table
* Download table - Click MORE and then Click Download as CSV. Export to CSV is limited to 20,000 rows.
* Show/Hide details - Click to view additional information on the selected row

### Show/Hide Details

Click a row in the Nodes table, then click the Show details button at the upper right of the action bar. The Metrics screen appears, containing a dropdown allowing you to switch between **Resource utilization** and **GPU profiling** metrics views:

* **Resource utilization** - Displays general GPU, CPU and network metrics
* **GPU profiling** - Shows additional NVIDIA-specific metrics

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

GPU profiling metrics are disabled by default. If unavailable, your administrator must enable it under **General settings** → Analytics → GPU profiling metrics. Before enabling, the administrator must configure GPU profiling through the DCGM Exporter and NVIDIA Run:ai Prometheus integration. For configuration steps, see [GPU profiling metrics](/self-hosted/platform-management/monitor-performance/gpu-profiling-metrics.md).
{% endhint %}

#### Resource Utilization

* **GPU utilization**\
  Per GPU graph and an average of all GPUs graph, all on the same chart, along an adjustable period allows you to see the trends of all GPUs compute utilization (percentage of GPU compute) in this node.
* **GPU memory utilization**\
  Per GPU graph and an average of all GPUs graph, all on the same chart, along an adjustable period allows you to see the trends of all GPUs memory usage (percentage of the GPU memory) in this node.
* **CPU compute utilization**\
  The average of all CPUs’ cores compute utilization graph, along an adjustable period allows you to see the trends of CPU compute utilization (percentage of CPU compute) in this node.
* **CPU memory utilization**\
  The utilization of all CPUs memory in a single graph, along an adjustable period allows you to see the trends of CPU memory utilization (percentage of CPU memory) in this node.
* **CPU memory usage**\
  The usage of all CPUs memory in a single graph, along an adjustable period allows you to see the trends of CPU memory usage (in GB or MB of CPU memory) in this node.
* **NVLink bandwidth total**\
  The rate of data transmitted / received over NVLink, not including protocol headers, in bytes per second. The value represents an average over a time interval and is not an instantaneous value. The rate is averaged over the time interval. For example, if 1 GB of data is transferred over 1 second, the rate is 1 GB/s regardless of the data transferred at a constant rate or in bursts. The theoretical maximum NVLink Gen2 bandwidth is 25 GB/s per link per direction.

#### GPU Profiling

Select **GPU profiling** from the dropdown to view extended GPU device-level metrics such as memory bandwidth, SM occupancy, and other data.

* For the full list of supported metrics, see [Metrics and telemetry](/self-hosted/platform-management/monitor-performance/metrics.md#gpu-profiling).
* For definitions and technical descriptions, refer to the [NVIDIA documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/dcgm/latest/user-guide/feature-overview.html#profiling-metrics).

#### Navigating the Graphs

* For GPUs charts - Click the GPU legend on the right-hand side of the chart, to activate or deactivate any of the GPU lines.
* You can click the date picker to change the presented period
* You can use your mouse to mark a sub-period in the graph for zooming in, and use the ‘Reset zoom’ button to go back to the preset period
* Changes in the period affect all graphs on this screen.
