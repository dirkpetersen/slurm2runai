# Projects

Researchers submit AI workloads to NVIDIA Run:ai. To control how resources are allocated and prioritized across teams and initiatives, NVIDIA Run:ai uses [Projects](/self-hosted/platform-management/aiinitiatives/adapting-ai-initiatives.md#mapping-your-organization) as the primary organization management unit. Projects allow administrators to define resource quotas, scheduling behavior, access controls, and policy enforcement, while logically separating workloads between different organizational efforts.

A project can represent a team, an individual user, or a specific initiative, and can be assigned dedicated GPU and CPU quotas, scheduling rules, and permissions. Projects can also be grouped into [departments](/self-hosted/platform-management/aiinitiatives/organization/departments.md) to reflect the organizational hierarchy and enable centralized resource governance.

For example, a team working on a face-recognition initiative might collaborate under a shared project named `face-recognition-2024`. Alternatively, each team member can be assigned an individual project with a personal resource quota to ensure predictable and isolated resource usage.

## Projects Table

The Projects table can be found under **Organization** in the NVIDIA Run:ai platform.

The Projects table provides a list of all projects defined for a specific cluster, and allows you to manage them. You can switch between clusters by selecting your cluster using the filter at the top.

## Adding a New Project

1. Click **+NEW PROJECT**
2. Select a **scope.** Choose the department or organizational scope under which the project will be created. You can view and select only the clusters for which your assigned roles grant you permission.
3. Enter a **name** for the project. Project names must start with a letter and can only contain lower case Latin letters, numbers or a hyphen ('-’).
4. **Namespace** associated with the project. Each project is mapped to a Kubernetes namespace in the cluster. All workloads created under this project run in that namespace.
   * By default, NVIDIA Run:ai creates a new namespace in the Kubernetes cluster using the project's name with the `run:ai` prefix (`runai-<project-name>`).
   * Alternatively, you can use an existing namespace from the cluster. You must associate this namespace with the new project using the provided `kubectl` command. Copy the command shown in the UI and run it in your terminal to complete the association.
5. Choose how to proceed:

   * Click **CREATE PROJECT & CLOSE** to create the project without assigning resources.
   * Click **CREATE PROJECT & CONTINUE** to set dedicated resources and scheduling guarantees.

   <div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="hint" data-style="info" class="hint hint-info"><p><strong>Note</strong></p><ul><li>The project is created and appears in the <strong>Projects</strong> grid.</li><li><p>When you select <strong>CREATE PROJECT &#x26; CLOSE</strong>, the project is created without assigned resources. The project’s quota is set to 0, which means workloads can run only when spare GPUs are available. The following default settings are applied:</p><ul><li>The project is created with a <strong>Medium Low</strong> rank.</li><li>Over quota weight is always applied when distributing over-quota GPUs among projects in the same rank. By default, the project’s weight is derived proportionally from its assigned GPU quota. Since the quota is set to 0, the effective weight is 0. If <strong>Over quota weight</strong> is enabled via <strong>General settings</strong>, the project is assigned a default weight of 2.</li></ul></li></ul></div>

### Assigning GPU Quota

Assign GPUs to the project and define how the [Scheduler](/self-hosted/platform-management/runai-scheduler/scheduling/concepts-and-principles.md) prioritizes node pools when running the project’s workloads.

1. Review the **node pools** available to the project. By default, a project inherits the node pools defined at the department level. This represents the default (suggested) configuration set by the department and can be changed per project by selecting which node pools are available and adjusting their order.
2. Add **node pools** and set the default order in which workloads will be scheduled to use them. The leftmost node pool is the first one workloads will attempt to schedule onto. The Scheduler first tries to allocate resources using the highest priority node pool, then the next in priority, until it reaches the lowest priority node pool list, then the Scheduler starts from the highest again.

   <div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="hint" data-style="info" class="hint hint-info"><p><strong>Note</strong></p><ul><li>When no node pools are configured, you can assign quota for the whole project, instead of per node pool. After node pools are created, you can assign quota for each node pool separately.</li><li>The order of node pools can be overridden during workload submission by an admin policy or by the user.</li></ul></div>
3. Review the department's GPU quota per node pool:
   * **Unassigned** - The number of GPUs not assigned as quota to subordinate projects.
   * **Total** - The total number of GPUs assigned to the department in this node pool.
4. Set the project's **GPU quota** in the selected node pool. A **Quota distribution** graph next to the project shows how GPUs are distributed across the department for that node pool. The graph reflects:
   * **Assigned quota** - The number of GPUs from the node pool that are assigned to this project.
   * **Unassigned quota** - The number of GPUs still available in the node pool that are not yet assigned for any project.
   * **Sum of other projects’ assigned quota** - The total number of GPUs already assigned to all other projects in the same node pool.

     <div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="hint" data-style="info" class="hint hint-info"><p><strong>Note</strong></p><ul><li>If the department’s quota is set to <strong>Unlimited</strong>, projects under that department can consume available GPUs up to the physical capacity of the node pool or cluster.</li><li><p>If the department’s quota is limited, project behavior depends on whether the <strong>Limit projects from exceeding department quota</strong> is enabled/disabled via <strong>General settings</strong>:</p><ul><li>If disabled, projects can be assigned a GPU quota that exceeds the department quota. In this case, the system may display warnings, but the department quota is not enforced.</li><li>If enabled, the project’s assigned GPU quota must remain within the department quota. You cannot assign more GPUs than the department has available.</li></ul></li><li>Setting a quota to 0 (GPU, CPU, or CPU memory) and disabling <strong>Over quota weight</strong> via <strong>General settings</strong>, means the project is blocked from using those resources on this node pool.</li></ul></div>
5. You can adjust **other projects' quotas** to free up additional resources. A table lists all projects and their assigned GPU quotas. Updating these values redistributes the department’s assigned and unassigned GPU quota across projects for the selected node pool, as reflected in the **Quota distribution** graph next to each project:
   * Use the **Search** icon to find a project
   * Click the **GPU** quota value and set the number of GPUs
   * Click **APPLY**
6. These steps apply to the selected node pool. If multiple node pools are configured, repeat the process for each.
7. Click **SAVE & CONTINUE**

### Defining GPU Over Quota

Define how workloads can consume GPUs beyond the project’s assigned quota when additional resources are available.

1. **Allow workloads to exceed the project’s quota** is enabled by default, allowing workloads in the project to consume GPUs beyond the assigned quota. If disabled, workloads from the project will run only within the assigned quota and will not consume additional GPUs, even if resources are available.

   <div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="hint" data-style="info" class="hint hint-info"><p><strong>Note</strong></p><p>Workloads running over quota are <strong>opportunistic</strong> and may be preempted or stopped at any time when higher priority workloads require resources.</p></div>
2. Set the **max GPU allocation**. This value defines the maximum GPU device allocation the project can get from the node pool, representing the maximum sum of assigned quota and over-quota GPUs:
   * By default, this field is set to **Unlimited**, allowing the project to consume any available over-quota GPUs
   * Enter a **number** equal to or above the assigned quota
3. Rank projects in the order in which their workloads will be scheduled. A project’s **rank** determines the scheduling priority of its workloads only when competing for over-quota GPUs within the same node pool. By default, projects are assigned a **Medium Low** rank. Projects with a higher rank are scheduled before projects with a lower rank when over-quota GPUs become available. When multiple projects share the same rank, available over-quota GPUs are distributed according to each project’s **weight**:

   * Filter the list of projects:
     * Click **Add filter**
     * Select **Rank** to filter by rank level, or **Project** to filter by project name
     * Enter or select the filter criteria and click **APPLY**
   * Locate and select projects:
     * Locate the project or projects whose rank you want to change
     * Select one or more projects
   * Change the rank:
     * Click **MOVE TO RANK**
     * In the **Move to Rank** dialog, select the destination rank
     * Click **MOVE \<n> PROJECTS**

   To learn more about project ranks, see [The NVIDIA Run:ai Scheduler: concepts and principles](/self-hosted/platform-management/runai-scheduler/scheduling/concepts-and-principles.md).
4. Assign **weights** to determine the projects' share of resources. A project’s weight determines how available over-quota GPUs are distributed between projects that have the same rank within the same node pool. Weight behavior depends on whether **Over quota weight** is enabled or disabled via **General settings**. When disabled, the project’s weight is proportional to its assigned GPU quota, displayed for reference, and cannot be edited. When enabled, all projects within the same rank are assigned a **default weight of 2**, and the value can be adjusted per project:
   * Filter the list of projects:
     * Click **Add filter**
     * Select **Rank** to filter by rank level, or **Project** to filter by project name
     * Enter or select the filter criteria and click **APPLY**
   * Review weight distribution:
     * Projects are grouped by rank
     * For each project, the **Weight distribution** graph shows:
       * The project’s **weight**
       * The **total weight of other projects** in the same rank
   * Edit the project’s weight (when Over quota weight is enabled):
     * Click the **Weight** value for the project and enter a value
     * Click **APPLY**
5. These steps apply to the selected node pool. If multiple node pools are configured, repeat the process for each.
6. Click **SAVE &** **CONTINUE**

### Assigning CPU Quota

Assign CPU resources (cores and memory) to the project and define the maximum CPU usage per node pool. This form is displayed only if **CPU quota** is enabled via the **General settings**.

1. Set the number of **CPU (Cores)** the project can use in the selected node pool. By default, CPU cores are set to **Unlimited**, allowing the project to consume any available CPU resources in the node pool. Enter a **number**.
2. Set the amount of **CPU memory** available to the project in the selected node pool. By default, CPU memory is set to **Unlimited**, allowing the project to consume any available CPU resources in the node pool. Enter a **number** and select a unit (**MB**, **MiB**, or **GB**).

   <div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="hint" data-style="info" class="hint hint-info"><p><strong>Note</strong></p><ul><li><p>If the department’s quota is limited, project behavior depends on whether the <strong>Limit projects from exceeding department quota</strong> is enabled/disabled via <strong>General settings</strong>:</p><ul><li>If disabled, projects can be assigned a CPU quota that exceeds the department quota. In this case, the system may display warnings, but the department quota is not enforced.</li><li>If enabled, the project’s assigned CPU quota must remain within the department quota. You cannot assign more CPU resources than the department has available.</li></ul></li><li>When the <strong>CPU quota</strong> feature flag is disabled, any previously set CPU quotas for a project are automatically removed.</li></ul></div>
3. These steps apply to the selected node pool. If multiple node pools are configured, repeat the process for each.
4. Click **SAVE & CONTINUE**

### Setting Scheduling Rules

Scheduling rules control how compute resources are used by workloads. The restrict either the resources (nodes) on which workloads can run or the duration of the run time. Scheduling rules are set for projects and apply to specific workload types. By default, projects inherit scheduling rules from their parent department. Project-level scheduling rules can be used to add or override restrictions for workloads in that project. See [Scheduling rules](/self-hosted/platform-management/policies/scheduling-rules.md) for more details.

1. Click **+RULE**
2. Select a rule type from the dropdown:
   * **+ Idle GPU timeout** - Limit the duration of a workload whose GPU is idle
   * **+ Workload time limit** - Set a time limit for workspaces regardless of their activity (e.g., stop the workspace after 1 day of work)
   * **+ Node type (Affinity**) - Limit workloads to run on specific node types
3. For each rule, select the **workload type(s)** to which the rule applies and configure the rule parameters
4. Click **SAVE & CONTINUE**

Once scheduling rules are set for a project, all matching workloads associated with the project have the restrictions applied to them, as defined, when the workload is submitted. New scheduling rules added to a project are not applied over previously created workloads associated with that project.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

* When editing a scheduling rule within a project, you can only **tighten** rules inherited from the department (for example, by setting a shorter time limit).
* Scheduling rules defined at the department level **cannot be deleted** from within a project.
  {% endhint %}

### Applying Access Rules

1. Click **+ACCESS RULE**
2. Select a subject - **User, SSO group**, or **Service account**
3. Select or enter the subject identifier. You can define up to 10 subjects of the selected type:
   * **User email** for a local user created in NVIDIA Run:ai or for SSO user as recognized by the IDP
   * **Group name** as recognized by the IDP
   * **Service account name** as created in NVIDIA Run:ai
4. Select a **role**
5. Click **SAVE RULE**
6. Click **CLOSE**

## Editing a Project

To edit a project:

1. Select the project you want to edit
2. Click **EDIT**
3. From the dropdown menu, select the form you want to modify
4. Update the settings and click **SAVE & CONTINUE**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

When editing a project:

* You can navigate directly to a specific form without completing the full project creation flow again.
* Changes apply only to the selected form; previously configured settings in other forms remain unchanged.
* You cannot reduce GPU and CPU quotas below the quotas currently consumed by **non-preemptible** workloads.
  {% endhint %}

## Viewing a Project’s Policy

To view the policy of a project:

1. Select the project for which you want to view its [policies](/self-hosted/platform-management/policies/workload-policies.md). This option is only active for projects with defined policies in place.
2. Click **VIEW POLICY** and select the workload type for which you want to view the policies
3. In the Policy form, view the workload rules that are enforcing your project for the selected workload type as well as the defaults:
   * **Parameter** - The workload submission parameter that Rules and Defaults are applied to
   * **Type (applicable for data sources only)** - The data source type (Git, S3, nfs, pvc etc.)
   * **Default** - The default value of the Parameter
   * **Rule** - Set up constraints on workload policy fields
   * **Source** - The origin of the applied policy (cluster, department or project)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

The policy affecting the project consists of rules and defaults. Some of these rules and defaults may be derived from policies of a parent cluster and/or department (source). You can see the source of each rule in the policy form.
{% endhint %}

## Deleting a Project

To delete a project:

1. Select the project you want to delete
2. Click **DELETE**
3. On the dialog, click **DELETE** to confirm

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

**Clusters < v2.20**

Deleting a project does not delete its associated namespace, any of the workloads running using this namespace, or the policies defined for this project. However, any assets created in the scope of this project such as compute resources, environments, data sources, templates and credentials, are permanently deleted from the system.

**Clusters >=v2.20**

Deleting a project does not delete its associated namespace, but will attempt to delete it’s associated workloads and assets. Any assets created in the scope of this project such as compute resources, environments, data sources, templates and credentials, are permanently deleted from the system.
{% endhint %}
