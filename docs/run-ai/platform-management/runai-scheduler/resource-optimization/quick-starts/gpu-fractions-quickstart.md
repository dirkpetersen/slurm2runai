# Launching Workloads with GPU Fractions

This quick start provides a step-by-step walkthrough for running a Jupyter Notebook workspace using [GPU fractions](/self-hosted/platform-management/runai-scheduler/resource-optimization/fractions.md).

NVIDIA Run:ai’s GPU fractions provides an agile and easy-to-use method to share a GPU or multiple GPUs across workloads. With GPU fractions, you can divide the GPU/s memory into smaller chunks and share the GPU/s compute resources between different workloads and users, resulting in higher GPU utilization and more efficient resource allocation.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure:

* You have created a [project](/self-hosted/platform-management/aiinitiatives/organization/projects.md) or have one created for you.
* The project has an assigned quota of at least 0.5 GPU.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

Flexible workload submission is enabled by default. If unavailable, contact your administrator to enable it under **General settings** → Workloads → Flexible workload submission.
{% endhint %}

## Step 1: Logging In

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="UI" %}
Browse to the provided NVIDIA Run:ai user interface and log in with your credentials.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="CLI v2" %}
Run the below --help command to obtain the login options and log in according to your setup:

```sh
runai login --help
```

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="API" %}
To use the API, you will need to obtain a token as shown in [API authentication](https://run-ai-docs.nvidia.com/api/2.25/getting-started/how-to-authenticate-to-the-api).
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Step 2: Submitting a Workspace

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="UI - Flexible" %}

1. Go to the Workload manager → Workloads
2. Click **+NEW WORKLOAD** and select **Workspace**
3. Select under which **cluster** to create the workload
4. Select the **project** in which your workspace will run
5. Select **Start from scratch** to launch a new workspace quickly
6. Enter a **name** for the workspace (if the name already exists in the project, you will be requested to submit a different name)
7. Click **CONTINUE**

   In the next step:
8. Under **Environment**, click the **load** icon. A side pane appears, displaying a list of available environments. Select the **‘jupyter-lab’** environment for your workspace (Image URL: `jupyter/scipy-notebook)`
   * If ‘jupyter-lab’ is not displayed in the gallery, follow the below steps to create a one-time environment configuration:
     * Enter the jupyter-lab **Image URL** - `jupyter/scipy-notebook`
     * Tools - Set the connection for your tool
       * Click **+TOOL**
       * Select **Jupyter** tool from the list
     * Set the runtime settings for the environment. Click **+COMMAND & ARGUMENTS** and add the following:

       * Enter the command - `start-notebook.sh`
       * Enter the arguments - `--NotebookApp.token=''`

       **Note:** If [path-based routing](/self-hosted/infrastructure-setup/advanced-setup/container-access/external-access-to-containers.md#access-to-the-running-workloads-container) is enabled on the cluster, enter `--NotebookApp.base_url=/${RUNAI_PROJECT}/${RUNAI_JOB_NAME} --NotebookApp.token=''`.
9. Under **Compute resources**, click the **load** icon. A side pane appears, displaying a list of available compute resources. Select the **‘small-fraction’** compute resource for your workspace.
   * If ‘small-fraction’ is not displayed in the gallery, follow the below steps to create a one-time compute resource configuration:
     * Set **GPU devices** per pod - 1
     * Enable **GPU fractioning** to set the GPU memory per device:
       * Select **% (of device)** - Fraction of a GPU device’s memory
       * Set the memory **Request** - 10 (the workload will allocate 10% of the GPU memory)
     * Optional: set the **CPU compute per pod** - 0.1 cores (default)
     * Optional: set the **CPU memory per pod** - 100 MB (default)
10. Click **CREATE WORKSPACE**
    {% endtab %}

7. Click **CONTINUE**

   In the next step:
8. Select the **‘jupyter-lab’** environment for your workspace (Image URL: `jupyter/scipy-notebook)`

   * If the ‘jupyter-lab’ is not displayed in the gallery, follow the below steps:
     * Click **+NEW ENVIRONMENT**
     * Enter jupyter-lab as the **name** for the environment. The name must be unique.
     * Enter the jupyter-lab **Image URL** - `jupyter/scipy-notebook`

       * Enter the arguments - `--NotebookApp.token=''`

       **Note:** If [path-based routing](/self-hosted/infrastructure-setup/advanced-setup/container-access/external-access-to-containers.md#access-to-the-running-workloads-container) is enabled on the cluster, enter `--NotebookApp.base_url=/${RUNAI_PROJECT}/${RUNAI_JOB_NAME} --NotebookApp.token=''`.
