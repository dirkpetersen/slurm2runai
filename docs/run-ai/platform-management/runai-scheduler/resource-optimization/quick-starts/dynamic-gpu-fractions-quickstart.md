# Launching Workloads with Dynamic GPU Fractions

This quick start provides a step-by-step walkthrough for running a Jupyter Notebook with [dynamic GPU fractions](/self-hosted/platform-management/runai-scheduler/resource-optimization/dynamic-fractions.md).

NVIDIA Run:ai’s dynamic GPU fractions optimizes GPU utilization by enabling workloads to dynamically adjust their resource usage. It allows users to specify a guaranteed fraction of GPU memory and compute resources with a higher limit that can be dynamically utilized when additional resources are requested.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure:

* You have created a [project](/self-hosted/platform-management/aiinitiatives/organization/projects.md) or have one created for you.
* The project has an assigned quota of at least 0.5 GPU.
* [Dynamic GPU fractions](/self-hosted/platform-management/runai-scheduler/resource-optimization/dynamic-fractions.md) is enabled.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

* Flexible workload submission is enabled by default. If unavailable, contact your administrator to enable it under **General settings** → Workloads → Flexible workload submission.
* Dynamic GPU fractions is disabled by default in the NVIDIA Run:ai UI. To use dynamic GPU fractions, it must be enabled by your administrator, under **General Settings** → Resources → GPU resource optimization.

## Step 1: Logging In

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="UI" %}
Browse to the provided NVIDIA Run:ai user interface and log in with your credentials.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="CLI v2" %}
Run the below --help command to obtain the login options and log in according to your setup:

```sh
runai login --help
```

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="API" %}
To use the API, you will need to obtain a token as shown in [API authentication](https://run-ai-docs.nvidia.com/api/2.25/getting-started/how-to-authenticate-to-the-api).

## Step 4: Connecting to the Jupyter Notebook

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="UI" %}

1. Select the newly created workspace with the Jupyter application that you want to connect to
2. Click **CONNECT**
3. Select the Jupyter tool. The selected tool is opened in a new tab on your browser.
4. Open a terminal and use the `watch nvidia-smi` to get a constant reading of the memory consumed by the pod. Note that the number shown in the memory box is the Limit and not the Request or Guarantee.
5. Open the file `Untitled.ipynb` and move the frame so you can see both tabs
6. Execute both cells in `Untitled.ipynb`. This will consume about **3 GB of GPU memory** and be well below the 4GB of the **GPU Memory Request** value.
7. In the second cell, edit the value after `--image-size` from 100 to 200 and run the cell. This will increase the GPU memory utilization to about 11.5 GB which is above the Request value.
   {% endtab %}

{% tab title="CLI v2" %}

1. To connect to the Jupyter Notebook, browse directly to <mark style="color:blue;">https\://\<COMPANY-URL>/\<PROJECT-NAME>/\<WORKLOAD-NAME></mark>
2. Open a terminal and use the `watch nvidia-smi` to get a constant reading of the memory consumed by the pod. Note that the number shown in the memory box is the Limit and not the Request or Guarantee.
